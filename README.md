@SiegeMT is my username that stands for CJ MorningThaw, my initials are not CJ but MorningThaw is a servername from Asheron's Call (around 1999?).
Miss those memories but really I can credit it for being able to type clearly and fast so silver linings.

I wish I could be processing music and doing audio deep learning but I'm stuck on my Senior project for my BSEE. 
Currently I'm trying my damndest to get a WebApp working for arcGIS using only Django, but given I'll be using HTML and JS anyway I may have to just use JS.

Due to that, and by no means did I ask for this, but I've fell into the spreadload learning scenario since things keep coming up. 

Also cut me some slack, I'm brand new to Github.
